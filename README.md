Introduction:
GANimate is an ongoing project that aims to utilize deep learning techniques to predict and generate three future images based on a single input image. The project recognizes its current limitations due to dataset constraints and acknowledges the need for significant modifications to achieve accurate and reliable predictions.

Project Description:
The primary objective of GANimate is to leverage generative adversarial networks (GANs) to forecast and generate future images given a single input image. By training a GAN model on a dataset comprising image sequences, the project seeks to learn the underlying patterns and dynamics of image evolution over time.

However, it is important to note that GANimate is currently in progress and not yet ready for direct implementation or practical use. Several crucial modifications and enhancements are required before it can be considered a fully functional tool. These modifications include:

Dataset Constraints: GANimate acknowledges the limitations posed by the dataset used for training. The current dataset may be limited in size or diversity, which can impact the model's ability to accurately predict future images. Expanding the dataset and ensuring its representativeness across various image sequences is crucial to improve the prediction performance.

Model Optimization: The current implementation of the GAN architecture within GANimate may require optimization to improve the accuracy of future image generation. This involves experimenting with different network architectures, loss functions, regularization techniques, and hyperparameter tuning to achieve better results.

Temporal Dependency Modeling: GANimate needs to effectively capture and model the temporal dependencies between consecutive images in a sequence. Modifying the architecture or incorporating recurrent neural networks (RNNs) or temporal convolutions can help capture the temporal context and improve the accuracy of future image prediction.
